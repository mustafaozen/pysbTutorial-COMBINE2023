    "### Simplified Cdc2 - Cyclin interaction model:\n",
    "Cdc2 and Cyclin controls major events in cell cycle. Activation of Cdc2/Cyclin complexes is responsible for mitosis. For the biological details and the model, see [Tyson, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.88.16.7328). The following diagram demonstrates the model details:  \n",

    "#### Interaction steps:\n",
    "    (1): Cyclin is synthesized de novo: \n",
    "        (None --> cyclin)\n",
    "    (2): Newly synthesized cyclin may be unstable: \n",
    "        (cyclin --> None)\n",
    "    (3): Cyclin binds to cdc2-P to form \"pre-Maturation Promoting Factor (MPF). At some point after heterodimer formation, the cyclin subunit is phosphorylated: \n",
    "        (cyclin + cdc2-P --> cyclin-P:cdc2-P)\n",
    "    (4-5): The cdc2 subunit is then reversibly dephosphorylated to form active-MPF: \n",
    "        (cyclin-P:cdc2-P <--> cyclin-P:cdc2)\n",
    "    (Dashed-arrow): Two active-MPF enhance the catalytic activity of the phosphatase: \n",
    "        (cyclin-P:cdc2 + cyclin-P:cdc2 + cyclin-P:cdc2-P --> cyclin-P:cdc2 + cyclin-P:cdc2 + cyclin-P:cdc2)\n",
    "    (6): Nuclear division is triggered when a sufficient quantity of MPF has been activated and concurrently active MPF is destroyed: \n",
    "        (cyclin-P:cdc2 --> cyclin-P + cdc2)\n",
    "    (7): After breakdown of the MPF complex, released phosphorylated cyclin is subject to rapid proteolysis: \n",
    "        (cyclin-P --> None)\n",
    "    (8-9): The cdc2 subunit is reversibly phosphorylated, and the cycle repeats itself: \n",
